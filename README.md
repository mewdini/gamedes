2. Use `mkdir` to create a folder named "release" using `mkdir release`
3. Use `cd` once again to move into the release folder using `cd release`
4. Run `cmake ..` to generate the cmake files necessary to compile the game, or the equivalent command on your system
5. Use `make` (or the equivalent command on your system) to compile the binary for the game
6. Finally, play our game with `.\main.exe`, `./main`, or whatever the binary name is on your system. You can use `ls` or `dir` to check the filename
